Dedalus code for homogenoeus/inhomogeneous model
==============================================
Structure of dedalus project
==============================================
1. Run name & detail setting
2. Run type, output frequency, domain size & (coef / forcing coef) setting
3. Giving Background field (forcing)
4. Create problem and define variables to do iteration
5. Equation set
6. Build solver & integration setting (give time scheme) & CFL
7. Give initial condition
8. Create file directory & start to output h5 file / Plot initial condition & save code
9. Main integration loop
